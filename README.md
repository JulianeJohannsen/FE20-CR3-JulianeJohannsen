This is a project from the bootcamp CodeFactory Vienna.
The task was to create a responsive restaurant website with the possibility to order food. Usage of Angular was required. For the responsiveness and style Bootstrap was used. Photos as guidance for the design were given. Following requirements should be fulfilled:
The project should contain at least 7 components (NavBar, Home, Footer, About Us, Menu, Details and Order(Cart)). Routing was required (SPA). Each dish must have certain properties, among them availability (Boolean). On the Menu the dishes should have the buttons "Details" and "Order". If the availability of the dish was false, instead of the buttons a message "not available" should be displayed.
The user should be able to order from the "Menu" or the "Details". In the "Cart" the total should be displayed and a service fee of 10% on top. When total with service would be more than 40 EUR, a discount of 15% should be given.
